# [Fix your RxJS 6 Imports & Operators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9fdpGthrXA)

RxJS 6 was released and unlike older RxJS versions, it requires you to adjust your code. The import paths changed due to internal structure changes and you'll also have to use operators a bit differently.

---

### The quick fix for updating a project to RxJS6

> `npm install --save rxjs-compat`

This should ensure backward compatibility, not requiring changes to old code, and not (bloating) adding too much size to your bundle

---

### `pipe()`

RxJS6 changed their package structure (resulting in a smaller bundle size, but also requiring updated import statements and operators) and pipeable operators.


from: `import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to: `import { Observable } from 'rxjs'`

from: `import 'rxjs/add/operator/map'`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to: `import { map } from 'rxjs/operators'`

from: `import 'rxjs/add/observable/fromPromise'`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to: `import { fromPromise } from 'rxjs'`

<br>

from:
```
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/throttle';
someObservable
  .map(...)
  .throttle(...)
  .subscribe(...)
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to:
```
import { map, throttle } from 'rxjs/operators'

someObservable
  .pipe(map(...),
        throttle(...))
  .subscribe(...)
```

<br>

Due to pipeable operators, some operators needed to be renamed because they clashed with reserved words in JavaScript â†’ because we're not calling them as methods anymore, they're now normal functions so they can't be named JS keywords. We see the following changes:

| prev        | new            |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| `do()`      | `tap()`        |
| `catch()`   | `catchError()` |
| `switch()`  | `switchAll()`  |
| `finally()` | `finalize()`   |
| `throw()`   | `throwError()` |
